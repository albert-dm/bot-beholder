#Bot Beholder

This is the app to behold your bot.

##Blip bot

Bot Beholder is developed based on the ChatBot developing platflorm BLiP (blip.ai). It integrates with your BLiP account to allow you to observe everything that happens with your bot and give you the tools to test its behavior. 

The app is still in development.

##Tracing

The tracing tool is connected in realtime to BLiP and feeds you with very usefull information about what is happening in the Chat, highlighting errors and important events.

##Testing

The testing tool is capable of creating Use Cases for your ChatBot, that can be used to run tests and make sure that everything works as you planned. 

The use of the Use Cases is also something that could be used in TDD (Test Driven Development)
