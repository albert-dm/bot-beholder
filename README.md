The objective of this project is to create template for complex React applications.

It comes with Redux and Router configured in the right way for developing multi-role applications, where the whole visual of the app changes depending on the user role. 

Besides all of this, it also provides integration with ReactMD (Material Design) and Semantic UI, each one with a specific branch. 

More information will be added during the development. This is a project in progress.
